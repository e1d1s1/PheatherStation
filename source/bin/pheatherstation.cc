int led = D0; // LED is connected to D0

// This routine runs only once upon reset

}

// This routine loops forever

	digitalWrite(led, HIGH);  // Turn ON the LED
	delay(1000);              // Wait for 1000mS = 1 second
	digitalWrite(led, LOW);   // Turn OFF the LED
	delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
